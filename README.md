# Order Execution and Management System for Deribit Test

## Objective
A high-performance C++ system for order execution and management on the Deribit Test platform. The system enables seamless trading of Spot, Futures, and Options with real-time market data updates and comprehensive order management functionalities.

---

## Features

### Order Management
- **Place Order**: Execute new trades on supported instruments.
- **Cancel Order**: Cancel open orders.
- **Modify Order**: Edit existing orders.
- **Get Orderbook**: Fetch the current orderbook data for selected symbols.
- **View Current Positions**: Display active positions for all instruments.

### Real-Time Market Data
- **WebSocket Integration**:
  - Real-time streaming of market data.
  - WebSocket server for client subscriptions to symbols.
  - Continuous orderbook updates for subscribed symbols.

### Market Coverage
- **Instruments**: Spot, Futures, and Options.
- **Scope**: All supported symbols on the Deribit Test platform.

### Performance Monitoring
- **Execution Timing Logs**:
  - Logs are generated for key operations (place order, cancel order, modify order, get orderbook, view position, view open orders).
  - Helps in tracking the performance of different functionalities.
  - Provides time taken for each operation in seconds.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **A C++ compiler** supporting C++17 (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- **An active account** on Deribit Test.

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ORDER-EXECUTION-AND-MANAGEMENT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure your system has the necessary libraries installed for JSON parsing and WebSocket integration.

3. **Configure API Keys**  
   Open the file `src/config/api_config.h` and add your client ID and client secret generated from Deribit Test.
   Example:
   ```cpp
   #define CLIENT_ID "your_client_id"
   #define CLIENT_SECRET "your_client_secret"
   ```

4. **Compile the Project**  
   Use the following command to build the project:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 src/**/*.cpp -o main.exe -lcurl
   ```

5. **Run the Application**  
   Execute the compiled file:
   ```bash
   ./main.exe
   ```

## How It Works

The system provides the following order management operations:

1. **Place Order**: Allows users to execute buy or sell orders. The order type can be one of the following: `limit`, `stop_limit`, `stop_market`, `take_limit`, `take_market`, or `trailing_market`. For these advanced order types, users are prompted to input trigger prices and types.

2. **Cancel Order**: Enables users to cancel a specific order by providing its order ID.

3. **Modify Order**: Allows users to modify an existing order, including changing the price and quantity.

4. **Get Orderbook**: Fetches the current orderbook for a given symbol, displaying both bids and asks.

5. **View Position**: Displays the current position for a given symbol, including the size and average price.

6. **See Open Orders**: Lists all the current open orders.

## Performance Monitoring

- The system tracks and logs the execution time for each operation, helping you understand how long each API interaction takes. This is useful for diagnosing delays or ensuring optimal performance.
- The log will output the time taken in seconds for operations like placing, modifying, and canceling orders, as well as fetching the orderbook and viewing positions.

## 📈 Performance Analysis

### Benchmarking Methodology
- Latency was measured internally by recording timestamps before and after each major API call.
- Metrics were collected for:
  - Order placement
  - Orderbook retrieval
  - Position retrieval
  - Open orders retrieval
  - Order modification
- Measurements are printed to the console for real-time monitoring.

### Benchmark Results
| Operation               | Average Latency |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Order Placement          | ~1000 milliseconds |
| Orderbook Fetch          | ~500 milliseconds |
| View Position            | ~400 milliseconds |
| Open Orders Fetch        | ~450 milliseconds |
| Modify Order             | ~700 milliseconds |

### Observations
- Authentication introduces a slight overhead in initial API requests.
- REST API calls typically complete in under 1 second.
- Orderbook fetches are relatively fast but could benefit from persistent connections.
- Order placement and modification are the most time-consuming operations.

### Potential Optimizations
- **Persistent HTTP sessions**: Reuse CURL handles to reduce SSL handshake overhead.
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Shift to using WebSocket feeds for faster orderbook updates.
- **Multithreading**: Handle API calls and WebSocket messages on separate threads to reduce blocking.
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Further optimize in-memory handling of market data for faster access.
